# FamilyTree
Build a system which can satisfy the below described scenario  
- Let there be a person X who has total money worth Y  
- Each time X has a child, X can give certain percent of Y to the child(let’s call it x1) 
- When X reaches a 5% of his total money worth, he cannot have any more children   
- Now X1 can also have children and he can also give certain percent of his money to them 
- The condition of 5% will also apply to X1 and this continues so on to any descendant    
- At any point when asked, give the details of let’s say X1 and all his descendants up to 2 generations (x1’s child and the child’s descendant). The detail may simply consist of name and current possession of money
